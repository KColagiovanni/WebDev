This project was built following the TWT Django Tutorial --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm1mokevMWk&t=3001s

Getting started:
- To install Django (assuming you already have Python installed), from the command line type: “pip install django”.
- From the command line, change directories so that you’re now in the directory where the Django project is and type: “python manage.py runserver”. 
- To create an admin login, stop the server (Ctrl + C) if it is running and type: “python manage.py createsuperuser”. Enter username, email, and password.
- To login as Admin, run the server with the URL specified in the console window when the server was started and append /admin to the end of it (ex. 127.0.0.1:8000/admin), and it should bring you to a login page.
